        "\n",
        "Now, imagine all of this happening simultaneously. Think about:\n",
        "- Your **stress levels**\n",
        "- The **irritation** you feel\n",
        "- The **speed** at which teachers give out the homework\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Volume**:\n",
        "   - The homework and worksheets represent the **data**.\n",
        "   - Too many homework assignments = **VOLUME**, which is the amount of data.\n",
        "   - Just like your brain struggles to handle this workload, systems find it difficult to process massive amounts of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Variety**:\n",
        "   - Homework from different subjects represents the **VARIETY** of data.\n",
        "   - In big data, this refers to how **heterogeneous** data types can be (e.g., numbers, text, images, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Velocity**:\n",
        "   - All teachers giving homework at the same time represents the **VELOCITY** of data.\n",
        "   - In big data, **velocity** refers to how quickly new data is generated and needs to be processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Veracity**:\n",
        "   - Teachers copying worksheets from websites without effort or quality control represents **VERACITY**.\n",
        "   - Veracity refers to whether the data can be **trusted** and validated.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Value**:\n",
        "   - When everything is due at once, you may rush through it, leading to lower quality work. This represents **VALUE**.\n",
